# Simple GCS

Simple GCS (Ground Control Station) is a simpler version of a GCS for remote drone piloting. The application sends UDP packets with request information for the UAV (velocity, thrust etcâ€¦), and receives packets from the drone with position and status. The application is developed using C++ with ImGui as the UI of choice, and currently simulating the drone there is a python script. The intention of this project is to create an actual drone to be controlled with this GCS. This project was inspired by my work at Airbus Defence and Space where I am currently working on simulations for SIRTAP.

## Installation

This project was built using CMake and vcpkg as the package manager, so the instructions will be tailored to those tools. Before you proceed with the setup, ensure that you have CMake and vcpkg installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, you can find comprehensive installation instructions on their respective official websites.

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started)

Once you have CMake and vcpkg set up, change the CMakeLists CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE to fit with your vcpkg path and follow these steps to build and run the project:

```
vcpkg install glfw3 nlohmann-json boost-asio
vcpkg integrate install
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```



## Usage

To start using the program just change the configuration file to make the ip addresses point to the right locations, and then run the python scripts under the tests folder for a simple dummy simulation of the UAV.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute or improve the code feel free to do it, just remember that configuration changes won't be accepted since this setup is meant for a particular environment. If you want to change the configuration feel free to fork the repo and make your changes accordingly.
